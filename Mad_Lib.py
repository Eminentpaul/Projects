Ladies, you are two of the smarter, most {adjective} woman in this entire office,
and I have come to you today because I need your help. I will be {adverb} honest: 
I have to take a big {noun} in the bathroom, and I need to find a stall with a strong
Wi-Fi signal.

I mean, data plans are {adverb} expensive and, without being too specific, I'm going to 
be in there for a very, very {adjective} time. I had the lunch special at Cafe el {place}
and it's like a tickling time {noun} in my {body_part}, if you know what I mean.
Anyway, since they removed the {adjective} magazines from the men's bathroom, I have a
difficult time concentrating on the {noun} at hand. The woman's restroom is right next door.
So if you don't mind, go in, check out the Wi-Fi and tell me which area has the most {adjective}
signal. 

I would do it myself, but once I sit down, I'm committed for at least {minutes} Mins.
 We can't be {adverb} obvious about this, though, so be {adjective}. Got it? Good. Now, please hurry.
 The turtle is starting to poke his head out of his {noun}, if you know what I mean.
